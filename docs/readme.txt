README FIRST
-----------------------

This module is originally written to use with radio, to show who is online (picture, start & end, name, title of show & what song is playing)
& who is on next with same details.

Use this as a banner rotator, to show your schedule, movies in tv or what ever you want to show on your frontpage on a timed basis.

Also I added the ability to link on to a more detailed description of the event as well as the ability to add dated playlists.
